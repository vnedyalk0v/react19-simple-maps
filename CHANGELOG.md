# Changelog

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 863c579: Fix all confirmed findings from the React 19 package audit:
  - **(4.1, 4.2) Geography loading model:** Remove broken Suspense wrapper from `Geographies` that never triggered. Expose `isLoading` and `error` from `useGeographies` and render SVG-safe loading/error fallbacks instead of invalid HTML `<div>` elements inside `<g>`.
  - **(5.1) Custom memo comparators:** Remove custom `memo` comparators from `Geographies` and `Geography` that silently blocked updates to forwarded DOM props (`aria-*`, `data-*`, `opacity`, `role`, etc.). Default `memo` shallow comparison is now used.
  - **(5.2) Focused style variant:** Separate hover and keyboard focus into independent state variables in `Geography` and `Marker`. The `focused` style variant is now applied on keyboard focus (`onFocus`/`onBlur`), while `hover` applies on mouse enter/leave.
  - **(5.3) scaleExtent prop:** `ZoomableGroup` now honors the `scaleExtent` prop when provided directly, instead of always deriving zoom bounds from `minZoom`/`maxZoom`.
  - **(6.1) Validation error messages:** Fix ~20 calls to `createGeographyFetchError` in `input-validation.ts` where the descriptive error message was passed in the wrong argument position (URL slot), resulting in generic error text. Security-related validation errors now correctly use the `SECURITY_ERROR` type.
  - **(6.2) Lockfile sync:** Regenerate `package-lock.json` to match `package.json` version `2.0.2`.
  - **(7.1) Debug render purity:** Move `setDebugMode` and `logRender` calls out of the render phase into `useEffect` to prevent global state mutation and console I/O during rendering, which is problematic under StrictMode and concurrent rendering.
  - **Error boundary SVG safety:** Change `DefaultErrorFallback` in `GeographyErrorBoundary` to render SVG-safe `<text>`/`<g>` elements instead of HTML `<div>`/`<button>`.

- dad7925: Fix security vulnerabilities identified in security best-practices review:
  - **SEC-001 (High):** Fix IPv6 private-address bypass in URL validation. Strip IPv6 brackets from `new URL().hostname` before matching, add IPv4-mapped IPv6 detection (both dotted-quad and hex forms), and expand reserved range coverage.
  - **SEC-002 (Medium):** Run `validateGeographyUrl()` in the preloading pipeline before any DNS prefetch, preconnect, or preload network activity.
  - **SEC-003 (Medium):** Canonicalize URLs (strip fragment, normalize port/host) before SRI hash lookup to prevent bypass via trivial URL variants.
  - **SEC-004 (Low):** Remove `frame-ancestors` and `X-Frame-Options` from HTML meta tags in examples (not enforced by browsers via meta); strengthen dev-only comments.
  - **SEC-005 (Low):** Redact `git.branch` in persisted bundle reports to prevent sensitive branch names leaking into CI artifacts. Add `BUNDLE_REPORT_REDACT_GIT` env var to omit all git metadata from reports.
  - **Build:** Set `NODE_ENV=production` in the `build` script so the Rollup Terser plugin is applied, enabling `drop_console` and `pure_funcs` to strip `console.log`/`console.warn`/`console.debug` from production bundles.

  Bundle Monitor Improvements:
  - Fix optimization status mapping — 0% completion now correctly reports `"not_started"` instead of `"partial"`. Status derives from numeric completionRate consistently (0% → not_started, 1–99% → partial, 100% → complete).
  - **Breaking (report schema):** `utilization.raw`, `utilization.gzip`, and `utilization.brotli` are now numbers (e.g. `93.7`) instead of strings (`"93.7"`). Brotli emits `null` instead of `"N/A"` when unavailable. Parallel formatted fields (`utilization.rawFormatted`, `utilization.gzipFormatted`, `utilization.brotliFormatted`) provide display-ready strings (e.g. `"93.7%"`).
  - **Breaking (report schema):** `react19Optimizations.*.completionRate` is now a number (e.g. `50`) instead of a string (`"50.0"`). A parallel `completionRateFormatted` field (e.g. `"50.0%"`) is provided for display.

- 44afd4a: Address follow-up review findings:
  - **useGeographies:** Abort stale async updates with an effect cleanup flag; expose `refetch()` to retry string URL loads.
  - **Types:** `GeographyData.error` is now `GeographyError | Error | null`; optional `refetch` on the hook result.
  - **Geographies / Geography:** Restore targeted `memo` comparators; stable loading fallback element; wire fallback retry to `refetch`.
  - **GeographyErrorBoundary:** Default fallback shows an accessible Retry control and vertically centers error text in SVG.
  - **Security:** Canonicalize URLs in `addCustomSRI`; extend IPv4 documentation (TEST-NET) ranges; clarify example HTML comments on meta vs HTTP headers.
  - **Preloading:** Mark URLs in the dedupe set after DNS/preconnect hints to avoid redundant hint calls in development.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 05f1bfc: Security hardening (7 fixes):
  - **[H-001]** Fix JSON-LD script-breakout XSS by escaping `<`, `>`, `&`, and Unicode line separators in `MapMetadata`.
  - **[H-002]** Prevent redirect-based SSRF bypass by using `redirect: 'manual'` and validating each redirect hop against the URL security policy.
  - **[M-001]** Enforce streaming response-size limits independent of the `Content-Length` header to prevent memory exhaustion.
  - **[M-002]** Deprecate `fetchGeographies` — it now delegates to the hardened `fetchGeographiesCache` pipeline.
  - **[M-003]** Align server actions in `GeographyActions` with the shared secure URL validator and fetch pipeline.
  - **[L-001]** Add prominent dev-only labeling and production CSP guidance in example HTML and SECURITY.md.
  - **[L-002]** Set `X-XSS-Protection: 0` consistently across all examples and documentation.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- c27cfb1: Fix package configuration and tooling issues
  - Remove deprecated `/* eslint-env browser */` comment that will error in ESLint v10
  - Reduce npm package size by excluding intermediate `dist/types/` build artifacts from published files
  - Quote lint script glob patterns for cross-platform shell compatibility

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- a7aa88d: BREAKING: Package is now ESM-only. CommonJS (`require`) and UMD builds are removed.
  Added `./utils` subpath export for direct utility imports.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix build failure caused by `captureOwnerStack` not being exported in React 19 stable
  - The `captureOwnerStack` API is only available in React's development builds, not in production. This caused build failures for users.
  - Replaced direct import with a safe wrapper function that conditionally accesses the API only in development mode.
  - Updated all dependencies to their latest versions (vitest 4.x, jsdom 27.x, eslint-plugin-react-hooks 7.x, etc.)
  - Fixed rollup config compatibility with updated @rollup/plugin-typescript

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e1cb62: Add opt-in debug mode for cleaner development experience

  Implements quiet-by-default debugging with opt-in activation via environment variable or component prop. This follows industry standards for library behavior and provides a more professional development experience.

  **New Features:**
  - `debug` prop on ComposableMap component for per-map debugging
  - `REACT_SIMPLE_MAPS_DEBUG` environment variable for global debugging
  - Quiet by default - no console output unless explicitly enabled

  **Breaking Change:**
  - Debug logging is now **disabled by default** (was previously enabled in development)
  - To restore previous behavior, set `REACT_SIMPLE_MAPS_DEBUG=true` or use `debug={true}` prop

  **Benefits:**
  - ✅ Cleaner development console by default
  - ✅ Professional library behavior following React/Next.js conventions
  - ✅ Granular control over debug output
  - ✅ Still provides rich debugging when needed

  **Migration:**
  - No action needed for most users (cleaner experience)
  - To enable debugging: add `debug={true}` prop or set environment variable

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d3ce74: Fix React DOM warnings in ZoomableGroup component

  Resolves console warnings about unrecognized DOM props by properly filtering internal ZoomableGroup props before forwarding to DOM elements. This eliminates development warnings while maintaining full functionality and backward compatibility.

  **Fixed warnings:**
  - `minZoom` prop on DOM element
  - `maxZoom` prop on DOM element
  - `scaleExtent` prop on DOM element
  - `enableZoom` prop on DOM element
  - `translateExtent` prop on DOM element
  - `enablePan` prop on DOM element

  **Changes:**
  - Modified ZoomableGroup prop destructuring to extract internal props
  - Added proper ESLint handling for intentionally unused variables
  - Maintained full React 19 compliance and functionality

  **Impact:**
  - ✅ Clean development experience with zero console warnings
  - ✅ No breaking changes or functional impact
  - ✅ Improved React 19 compliance
